- WHDLoad NoVBRMove: Turn NoVBRMove option on or off.
- WHDLoad Preload: Turn Preload option on or off.

Favourites mode can be set to the following:

- Add: Adds magazine to favourites and returns to AGS2 menu
- Add & Run: Add magazine to favourites and run it using WHDLoad.
- Remove: Queues magazine to be removed from favourites and returns to AGS2 menu.
- Off: Default run magazine using WHDLoad.

When turned on music a random .mod file is played while AGS2 menu is shown and will stop before running a magazine. By default there aren't installed any music .mod files. They can be must copied to directory "MENUSDIR:Menu/AGS2Magazines/Music" (unless changed).

WHDLOAD ButtonWait option makes WHDLoad wait for pressing a button when it shows pictures and/or plays music.

WHDLoad ExpChip option forces WHDLOAD to allocate required memory in Chip Memory and may result in performance degration.
This option can be turned on as an attempt to slow down magazines.

WHDLoad NoAutoVec option ensures WHDLoad doesn't quit, if unexpected autovector interrupt or NMI occurs.
This option can be turned on, if WHDLoad crashes with error message "NMI Autovector".

WHDLoad NoCache option makes WHDLOAD disable all caches. 
This option can be turned on as an attempt to slow down magazines.

WHDLoad NoVBRMove option moves the vector table using the VBR (Vector Base Register) to a different memory location.
This option can be turned on as an attempt to fix issues running magazines.

WHDLoad Preload option makes WHDLoad load data files and disk images into memory to increase performance.
This option is turned on by default to avoid screen flickering, when magazines are loading data files.
For lowend Amiga's without Fast memory or accelerator, this option can be turned off, so they can still run most WHDLoad magazines.

To preserve settings between reboots, use "Save settings" to write settings to harddisk.
